ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Gary!

Iâ€™m a software engineer based in Toronto, Canada, currently in my senior year of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, majoring in Software Engineering.
  
Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to experience a variety of software development internships during my undergraduate studies.
I have previously interned at [Verto Health](https://verto.health/), [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/), and I recently finished an internship at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

I'm always open to new opportunities! Feel free to learn more or reach out to me at:
