👋 Hi, my name is Gary!

I’m a software engineer based in Toronto, Canada, currently in my junior year studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto, majoring in Software Engineering.
  
I’ve been lucky enough to experience a variety of software development internships during my undergraduate studies.
I have previously interned at [Verto Health](https://verto.health/), and I recently finished a 16-month internship at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/).

I'm always open to new opportunities! Feel free to learn more or reach out to me at:
