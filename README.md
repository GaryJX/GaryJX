ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Gary!

Iâ€™m a software developer based in Toronto, Canada, and I am currently in my 3rd year of studying Computer Science at University of Toronto.

Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to experience a variety of software development internships during my undergraduate studies.
I have previously interned at [Verto Health](https://verto.health/), and I recently finished a 16-month internship at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/).

ðŸ‘€ I'm always open to new opportunities! Feel free to reach out to me at:
